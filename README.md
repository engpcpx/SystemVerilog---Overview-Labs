# üìò SystemVerilog for Design and Verification

Welcome to the **SystemVerilog for Design and Verification** labs repository!  
This collection of hands-on labs aims to help students, engineers, and enthusiasts practice and master SystemVerilog for both **design modeling** and **functional verification**.

---

## üìö Overview

This repository includes a total of 23 labs, progressing from simple designs to advanced verification techniques using:

- RTL modeling
- Testbenches
- Classes & polymorphism
- Randomization
- Functional coverage
- Assertions
- Synchronization with processes

Each lab is structured with design files, testbenches, and simulation commands to practice core concepts of SystemVerilog.

## üíæ Requirements

To run these labs, you will need:

- A SystemVerilog-compatible simulator (e.g., ModelSim, QuestaSim, Synopsys VCS, etc.)
- A code/text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic shell or command-line access

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Labs

Each lab directory contains:
- `*.sv` design files
- `*_tb.sv` testbench
- Simulation instructions or scripts

Example (using ModelSim):

```bash
cd lab01_register
vlog register.sv register_tb.sv
vsim -c -do "run -all" register_tb
